# Simple Control Device for turning on/off a load via wifi/mqtt/mobile phone.

This particular project used Electrodragon ESP Relay board. Amazing device for only 5-6$.
** Keep in mind that Electrodragon has several types of boards, so pick the one which would suite your needs.

This is  the one i used.
